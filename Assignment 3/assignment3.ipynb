    "- Risk: we are not allowed to make decision's based on race, gender and disability.<br/>\n",
    "- To do: gather data about students and courses. <br/>\n",
    "- Cost: will be zero in terms of currency, we only need to request data.<br/>\n",
    "- Constraints: time is the biggest constraint we only have a limited time before our deadlines.<br/>\n",
    "- Benefits: we will predict which students have a higher succes rate, so we can actively try to get them to come to our school.\n",
