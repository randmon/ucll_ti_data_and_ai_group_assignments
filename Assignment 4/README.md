# Data and AI Assignment 4 - Computer Visison

## Instructions to load in the data

- Move all the images into one folder inside the `Assingment 4` folder, name this folder `data`
- Run the `move_to_label.py` script. This script will move all the images into their respective folders (`ordered_data/0` to `ordered_data/2`)

Some images will be left over because they are not in the labeled set.

- for the heuristic notebook, you should download the Oude Fitness folder and paste it in "heuristic/data"
